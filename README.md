2020 done in Python. Average time for Part 1: `03:38:44` Average time differential: `01:18:35`

Am happy that I could get a star for every day at least, with a total of 48\* this year and also a few sub-1000 ranks.

Days `6,8,12,13` were partially written on my phone...

Days `7,8,12,20,22,24` I had real life obligations
